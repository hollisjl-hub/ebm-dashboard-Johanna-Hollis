# Organizational Evidence: Quality Assessment
# Evaluate the credibility and usefulness of organizational data collected

## Overall Data Quality Assessment

### Data Source Reliability

#### Primary Data Sources
**Data Source 1: Workday HRIS (Most Critical)**
- **Reliability Rating:** **HIGH** - This is our most trusted organizational data source
- **Data Collection Method:** Automated system data capture (hire dates, termination dates, demographics); HR-verified fields (termination reason codes assigned during offboarding with manager/HR review; reviewed in quarterly data audits)
- **Update Frequency:** Real-time for transactions (hires, terminations); daily batch updates for calculated fields (turnover rates)
- **Historical Availability:** Clean data back to January 2022 (system implementation); partial data 2020-2021 (migration limitations); pre-2020 archived and less reliable
- **Known Limitations:** 
  - Voluntary vs. involuntary termination coding subject to some judgment (gray areas like "mutual agreement")
  - Doesn't capture "quiet quitters" who stay physically but have mentally resigned
  - Birth year used to calculate generation may have errors if employee didn't provide accurate DOB
  - System migration in 2022 creates some data continuity challenges pre-2022

**Data Source 2: Exit Interview Database (Critical for "Why")**
- **Reliability Rating:** **MEDIUM** - Valuable insights but significant biases
- **Data Collection Method:** Structured exit interviews conducted by HR generalist (phone or in-person, 30-45 min); uses standard questionnaire with multiple-choice and open-ended questions; notes entered into database
- **Update Frequency:** Interviews conducted within 2 weeks of resignation notice (before actual last day); database updated weekly
- **Historical Availability:** Consistent structured format back to 2021; older data (pre-2021) exists but format/questions changed making comparisons difficult
- **Known Limitations:**
  - **68% completion rate** - 32% of departing employees decline interview (likely includes most negative departures - survivorship bias)
  - **Social desirability bias:** Employees may soften criticism to preserve references/relationships
  - **Bridge-burning avoidance:** Legal/HR concerns may lead to sanitized feedback
  - **Recency bias:** Recent frustrations may overshadow longer-term patterns
  - **Post-decision rationalization:** After accepting new job, employees may emphasize positive aspects of leaving
  - **Interviewer effect:** Different HR generalists may probe/record differently despite standard protocol

**Data Source 3: Annual Engagement Survey (Perceptions & Attitudes)**
- **Reliability Rating:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Good for perceptions, less reliable for predicting behavior
- **Data Collection Method:** Annual online survey administered by Qualtrics; 40 questions using 5-point Likert scale plus 3 open-ended questions; anonymous (can't link to individual employees but can filter by demographics in aggregate)
- **Update Frequency:** Annual (Q3 each year); quarterly pulse surveys added in 2024 (5 questions, less comprehensive)
- **Historical Availability:** Consistent survey instrument 2022-2024 (3 years comparable); prior years used different vendor/questions (not comparable)
- **Known Limitations:**
  - **Point-in-time snapshot:** Annual timing means can't track changes mid-year; Q3 timing may bias results (post-summer, pre-bonus)
  - **Response bias:** 76% response rate is good but 24% non-responders may skew results (possibly most disengaged employees don't participate)
  - **Social desirability:** Despite anonymity, employees may give "acceptable" answers
  - **Perception vs. reality:** Measures employee feelings, not objective conditions (employee may feel "no career path" when paths exist but aren't communicated)
  - **Cohort aggregation:** Millennials/Gen Z analyzed together - may miss differences between older millennials (age 43) and younger Gen Z (age 22)

#### Data Integration Assessment
**Cross-System Consistency:** **HIGH** - Data aligns well across systems
- Headcount totals match across Workday (666 millennials/Gen Z), Finance records (payroll), and engagement survey (512 responses / 76% = 673 invited, within margin of timing differences)
- Turnover counts verified across Workday termination records and Finance separation processing
- Exit interview database links to Workday termination records (can cross-reference timing, demographics)

**Data Definition Consistency:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Most definitions align, some gray areas
- "Voluntary turnover" definition consistent across Workday and exit interviews
- **Gray area:** "Mutual separation" coded as voluntary but questionable (small number, ~5% of exits)
- "Millennial/Gen Z" definition consistent (birth years 1981-2012) across all systems
- Performance ratings use same scale across system modules
- **Inconsistency:** "Career development" measured differently in engagement survey (one dimension) vs. exit interviews (multiple questions) - makes direct comparison imperfect

**Temporal Alignment:** **HIGH** - Data sources cover same time periods
- All primary analyses use Oct 2023-Sep 2024 as standard 12-month period
- Historical trends use calendar years (2022, 2023, 2024 YTD) for consistency
- Engagement survey (Q3 2024) aligns with same fiscal year as other metrics
- Exit interviews conducted throughout period (continuous data collection)

### Measurement Quality Analysis

#### Validity Assessment

**Face Validity:** **HIGH** - Measures clearly relate to retention problem
- **Problem Relevance Score:** **HIGH** - Measuring exactly what we need
  - Turnover rate directly measures the problem (departures)
  - Exit interview themes directly capture reasons for leaving
  - Engagement scores measure attitudes that predict turnover
  - Manager effectiveness scores measure key causal factor (Gallup: manager accounts for 70% of engagement variance)
  - Career development satisfaction measures specific driver of millennial/Gen Z turnover
- **Direct vs. Proxy Measures:** **Mostly Direct** with some proxies
  - **Direct measures:** Turnover rate, tenure at departure, exit reasons - these ARE the problem/causes
  - **Proxy measures:** Performance ratings as proxy for "high performer" (rating is subjective judgment, not objective performance); engagement scores as proxy for future turnover risk (correlation not perfect)
  - **Gap:** No direct measure of "manager quality" - using effectiveness scores from 360 reviews which are perceptual

**Construct Validity:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Measures generally capture intended concepts but with some noise
- **Measurement Alignment:** Good alignment between theoretical concepts and measures
  - Theory: Millennials/Gen Z prioritize career development → Measure: Engagement survey "career development" dimension and exit interview "career advancement" reasons → **Strong alignment**
  - Theory: Manager quality drives retention → Measure: Exit interview "manager concerns," engagement "my manager" dimension, 360 manager effectiveness scores → **Strong alignment across multiple measures**
  - Theory: Flexibility matters to young employees → Measure: Exit interview flexibility mentions, engagement work-life balance dimension → **Moderate alignment** (flexibility is subset of work-life balance)

- **Confounding Factors:** Multiple factors could influence measures beyond intended constructs
  - **Turnover rate** could be influenced by: Industry-wide talent shortage (not just our problem), economic conditions (job market health), seasonal timing (Q1 spike), company growth/restructuring
  - **Exit interview themes** could be influenced by: What's socially acceptable to say ("career growth" safer than "my manager is terrible"), what new employer emphasized in recruiting
  - **Engagement scores** could be influenced by: Recent company news (good/bad earnings, layoffs elsewhere), survey timing (after major announcement), survey fatigue
  - **Limitation:** Hard to isolate our organizational factors from external market dynamics

**Criterion Validity:** **MEDIUM** - Measures correlate with external standards moderately well
- **External Validation:** 
  - Our turnover rate (23.4%) vs. SHRM benchmark (18.1%) = **Valid comparison** using same calculation methodology
  - Our engagement survey uses Qualtrics normative database for benchmarking = **Valid comparison** with similar industries
  - Exit interview themes match Gallup's national research (career development #1, manager #2) = **External validation of findings**
  - **Limitation:** Our organization may have unique context that makes direct benchmarking imperfect

- **Predictive Value:** Moderate ability to predict outcomes
  - Engagement scores <60 predict turnover within 6 months in our data (26% of millennials/Gen Z scored <60) = **Validated predictive relationship**
  - Exit interview themes in 2022 predicted by 2024 problem areas (report said "career development" would be issue - confirmed) = **Historical predictive validity**
  - **Limitation:** Can predict group trends but not individual departures (many low-engagement employees stay, some high-engagement employees leave)

#### Reliability Assessment

**Measurement Consistency:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Measurements generally consistent but some variation
- **Temporal Stability:** Measures are relatively stable over short periods but show concerning trends over longer periods
  - Turnover rate shows consistent worsening trend (not random noise) = **Reliable signal**
  - Engagement scores stable within 2-3 points year-to-year for most dimensions = **Reliable measurement**
  - Exit interview themes remarkably consistent (career development, manager quality top 2 for 3 years) = **High reliability**
  - **Question:** Is trend real change or measurement drift? Likely real given convergence across sources

- **Inter-Rater Reliability:** **MEDIUM** - Some variation between different raters
  - Termination reason codes: HR generalists may code edge cases differently (estimated 5-10% of cases have judgment calls)
  - Exit interview notes: Different HR interviewers may probe depth differently or interpret/record responses with slight variations
  - Performance ratings: Known manager differences in rating philosophy (some rate tough, others inflate) despite calibration process
  - **Mitigation:** Regular calibration meetings, audit sampling, standard protocols help but don't eliminate variation

- **Internal Consistency:** **HIGH** - Related measures align well with each other
  - Exit interview themes + engagement survey low dimensions + 2022 report findings all point to same root causes (career development, manager quality) = **Strong internal consistency**
  - Turnover trend + engagement trend + cost trend all show same worsening pattern = **Consistent signal**
  - Millennials/Gen Z gap appears in multiple measures (turnover, engagement, tenure) = **Robust finding**

**Error Sources:** Multiple sources of measurement error exist

- **Systematic Errors:** Consistent biases in one direction
  - **Social desirability bias in surveys/interviews:** Consistently underestimates negative sentiment
  - **Performance rating inflation:** Consistently overstates employee quality (affects "high performer" identification)
  - **Survivorship bias in exit interviews:** Consistently underrepresents most negative departures (32% non-response)
  - **Impact:** Likely means actual problems are worse than measured (conservative estimates)

- **Random Errors:** Inconsistent noise in measurement
  - Data entry errors in HRIS (wrong dates, typos in fields) - estimated <1% error rate
  - Survey response errors (misread questions, accidental clicks) - minimal impact with large sample
  - Interview transcription errors (misheard or misrecorded responses) - occasional but not systematic
  - **Impact:** Random errors wash out in aggregate analysis (less concern than systematic errors)

- **Human Errors:** Mistakes in data collection or entry
  - HR generalist forgets to code termination reason (rare, ~2% of cases)
  - Manager delays termination processing causing date inaccuracies
  - Employee provides incomplete/inaccurate information (e.g., wrong birth year for generation calculation)
  - **Mitigation:** Data validation rules, audit reviews, cross-checks reduce but don't eliminate

### Bias Assessment

#### Selection Bias

**Data Availability Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** **MEDIUM** - Some data missing creates moderate bias risk
- **Issue:** 32% of departing employees didn't complete exit interviews; those who skip likely more negative or burned bridges
- **Impact:** Exit interview data overrepresents "friendly leavers" and underrepresents "hostile leavers"; may understate severity of manager problems or cultural issues; themes we see (73% career development, 61% manager) are probably conservative - actual percentages likely higher
- **Partial mitigation:** Engagement survey captures some sentiment from employees who don't complete exit interviews (if they completed survey before leaving); Glassdoor reviews provide uncensored feedback channel

**Survivorship Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** **LOW-MEDIUM** - Some concern but not severe
- **Issue:** Analyzing only employees who left - can't directly compare to those who stayed on same dimensions (don't exit interview retained employees)
- **Impact:** Can identify what's common among leavers but harder to identify what distinguishes leavers from stayers beyond engagement survey
- **Mitigation:** Engagement survey provides comparison group (can compare engagement scores of those who left vs. stayed); internal analysis of high-performer departure rate provides some stayer comparison

#### Measurement Bias

**Gaming/Manipulation Risk:**
- **Risk Level:** **LOW** - Minimal evidence of gaming but can't rule out completely
- **Issue:** Could managers delay termination processing to shift turnover to different reporting period? Could exit interviews be influenced by HR wanting to avoid bad data?
- **Mitigation:** Termination effective date is system-locked once processed; Finance audits separation dates for payroll; exit interviews conducted by independent HR generalist (not reporting manager); anonymous engagement survey prevents manager manipulation
- **Assessment:** Low risk given system controls and third-party survey administration

**Reporting Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** **MEDIUM** - Some selectivity in what gets emphasized
- **Issue:** HR dashboard highlights certain metrics and may deemphasize others; executive presentations may frame data to support preferred narrative; "good news" may be more visible than "bad news"
- **Impact:** Overall turnover rate less prominently displayed than millennial/Gen Z rate in recent months (problem visibility increased only recently); 2022 report recommendations were under-emphasized when competing priorities emerged
- **Mitigation:** This evidence-based analysis examines full dataset, not just executive highlights; multiple data sources prevent single-source bias

#### Temporal Bias

**Timing Effects:**
- **Seasonal Variations:** **MEDIUM impact** - Q1 turnover typically 20-30% higher due to post-bonus departures; summer months higher for younger employees (life transitions); Q4 lowest (holiday season + bonus anticipation)
- **Cyclical Patterns:** **MEDIUM impact** - Annual performance review cycle affects turnover (spikes 2-3 months post-review if employees disappointed); bonus cycles affect departure timing
- **Event-Driven Changes:** **LOW impact** - No major one-time events (layoffs, acquisitions, scandals) in analysis period that would distort data; COVID-19 impact has normalized by analysis period
- **Adjustment:** Using 12-month rolling average smooths seasonal variation; comparing same quarters year-over-year accounts for seasonality

**Historical Context:**
- **Trend Analysis Validity:** **MEDIUM** - Historical trends somewhat predictive but context changes
- **Contextual Changes:** 
  - Labor market tightness increased 2022-2024 (external factor driving turnover up)
  - Company grew 18% headcount 2022-2024 (rapid growth may strain manager capacity)
  - Remote work expectations shifted post-pandemic (flexibility demands increased)
  - Competitive compensation increased (market-driven pressure)
- **Impact:** Some of our turnover increase is market-driven (external) vs. organization-driven (internal); hard to isolate how much is "our fault" vs. industry-wide trends
- **Mitigation:** Benchmarking to industry helps separate organizational factors from universal trends; our rate still 29% above industry average suggests organizational factors beyond market

### Completeness Assessment

#### Data Coverage

**Time Period Coverage:**
- **Adequate Historical Data:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - 3 years of clean data (2022-2024) is decent but not extensive
  - Can identify trends over 3-year period
  - Can establish 2022 baseline vs. current state
  - **Limitation:** Can't assess pre-pandemic patterns reliably; 3 years may not capture full economic cycle
  - **Assessment:** Sufficient for problem diagnosis and near-term solution design; ideal would be 5+ years

- **Pre-Problem Baseline:** **HIGH** - 2022 data provides good "before" snapshot
  - 2022 represents post-pandemic stabilization before problem accelerated
  - Can calculate how much metrics have worsened from 2022 baseline
  - **Strength:** Clear baseline enables quantifying deterioration

- **Comparison Periods:** **HIGH** - Can compare multiple time periods
  - Year-over-year: 2022 vs. 2023 vs. 2024
  - Quarterly: Q1 vs. Q2 vs. Q3 vs. Q4 for seasonality
  - Pre-departure vs. post-departure: Engagement scores for those who left vs. stayed
  - **Strength:** Multiple comparison periods strengthen causal inferences

**Organizational Coverage:**
- **Department/Unit Coverage:** **HIGH** - Data covers all departments with sufficient sample sizes
  - Can analyze turnover by department (Engineering 31%, Sales 28%, Operations 26%, etc.)
  - Can identify high-risk vs. low-risk areas
  - **Limitation:** Some smaller departments (<10 employees) aggregated for privacy
  - **Strength:** Enables targeted interventions in highest-need areas

- **Geographic Coverage:** **HIGH** - Organization is single-location so geography not a factor
  - All employees work from same metro area or remote (consistent policies apply)
  - No regional variation to account for
  - **Simplification:** Reduces confounding variables

- **Employee/Customer Coverage:** **HIGH for employees, N/A for customers**
  - 666 millennials/Gen Z out of 1,492 total employees = 45% of workforce
  - Sample size sufficient for statistical significance
  - All millennial/Gen Z employees included in analysis (census, not sample)
  - **Customer data:** Not directly relevant to internal retention problem; customer satisfaction tracked separately but not linked to turnover analysis for this project

#### Variable Coverage

**Comprehensive Problem Coverage:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Captures most aspects of problem but some gaps
- **Covered well:** 
  - Magnitude (turnover rate, costs)
  - Timing (tenure, trends)
  - Reasons (exit interviews, engagement)
  - Consequences (financial, talent loss)
  - Patterns (by department, performer level)
- **Gaps:**
  - Individual manager impact (privacy restrictions prevent manager-level reporting)
  - Team dynamics (don't measure team cohesion, peer relationships beyond manager)
  - External job offers (don't know what competitors offered, why they were more attractive beyond employee self-report)
  - Intent to leave (no predictive measure of who will leave next - only backward-looking)

**Outcome Measure Coverage:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Includes key outcomes but could be more comprehensive
- **Covered:** 
  - Voluntary turnover (primary outcome)
  - Engagement (leading indicator)
  - High-performer loss (talent quality outcome)
  - Cost (financial outcome)
- **Gaps:**
  - Team performance impact (don't measure how turnover affects remaining team productivity)
  - Innovation/quality impact (don't measure whether turnover affects product/service quality)
  - Customer satisfaction impact (don't link employee turnover to customer metrics)
  - Employer brand impact (don't measure whether turnover affects recruiting effectiveness, offer acceptance rates)

**Contextual Variable Coverage:** **MEDIUM** - Some context captured but not comprehensive
- **Covered:**
  - Demographics (age/generation)
  - Performance level (ratings)
  - Tenure
  - Department
  - Manager effectiveness (aggregate)
- **Gaps:**
  - Compensation relative to market (don't have precise competitive pay data for each role)
  - Individual career aspirations (don't systematically track what employees want long-term)
  - External job market activity (don't know who's actively looking, interviewing)
  - Personal life factors (don't track life events that might drive turnover - marriage, children, relocation)

### Accuracy Assessment

#### Data Verification Methods

**Cross-Verification Performed:**
- **Multiple Source Comparison:** **YES** - Verified turnover data across Workday, Finance payroll processing, exit interview database; headcount reconciled across systems monthly; engagement survey demographics matched to HRIS demographics
  - **Result:** <2% discrepancy across sources (within acceptable range; discrepancies due to timing differences when extracts pulled)
  - **Conclusion:** Data accuracy HIGH for core metrics

- **External Validation:** **PARTIAL** - Some external checks performed
  - Turnover rate compared to SHRM industry benchmark (validates calculation methodology)
  - Engagement survey results compared to Qualtrics normative database (confirms our scores in reasonable range)
  - Exit interview themes compared to Gallup national research (validates that our themes match broader patterns)
  - **Gap:** No external audit of our internal data; rely on internal controls
  - **Conclusion:** External validation where possible shows reasonable accuracy

- **Audit Trail Review:** **PARTIAL** - Some process verification
  - Finance conducts quarterly HR data audit for payroll accuracy (termination dates, status codes)
  - IT reviews data extraction queries for accuracy (SQL logic checked)
  - No formal third-party audit of data quality
  - **Conclusion:** Internal controls decent but could be strengthened with external audit

**Error Detection Efforts:**
- **Outlier Analysis:** **YES** - Unusual data points investigated
  - Flagged 3 employees with >10 years tenure coded as millennials (birth year errors) - corrected
  - Identified 2 terminations coded as "voluntary" but exit interview indicated performance issue - recoded
  - Found 1 department with 0% turnover (data pull error - corrected)
  - **Process:** Generated data quality reports with min/max values, flagged statistical outliers (>2 SD from mean), manually reviewed edge cases

- **Consistency Checks:** **YES** - Identified and resolved inconsistencies
  - Cross-checked termination dates in Workday vs. final paycheck dates (found 5 discrepancies - resolved)
  - Verified engagement survey demographic filters matched HRIS population (found slight mismatch in contractor inclusion - corrected)
  - Reconciled exit interview count to termination count (found 6 interviews for employees still showing active - timing issue resolved)

- **Logic Validation:** **YES** - Caught impossible/illogical values
  - Flagged tenure >company age (4 cases - rehires with incorrect tenure calculation - fixed)
  - Identified engagement scores outside 0-100 range (data entry error - corrected)
  - Found 1 employee in both millennial and Gen X categories (birth year overlap issue - clarified definition)
  - **System controls:** Workday has built-in validation rules preventing most logic errors at entry

#### Accuracy Limitations

**Known Data Errors:** Specific errors identified but not fully correctable
1. **Birth year accuracy:** ~5-10% of employees may have incorrect birth year in system (especially older employees who didn't verify); affects generation categorization; can't fully correct without asking all employees to verify (intrusive)

2. **Termination reason subjectivity:** "Mutual agreement" vs. "voluntary" vs. "involuntary" has ~5% gray area where coding is judgment call; recoded obvious errors but some ambiguity remains

3. **Exit interview incompleteness:** 32% non-response means missing data for 1/3 of population; no way to fully correct; those who don't respond may be systematically different

4. **Performance rating inflation:** Known issue that "meets expectations" is inflated baseline (should be average but likely above); affects "high performer" definition; can't recalibrate historical ratings

5. **Engagement survey non-response:** 24% didn't complete survey; may include most disengaged employees; can't know their views

**Estimated Error Rates:** Best guess at data error prevalence
- **Turnover rate calculation:** ±1-2% margin (highly accurate given system data; main errors from generation miscategorization and termination date timing)
- **Exit interview themes:** ±5-10% margin (subjective coding, non-response bias, social desirability)
- **Engagement scores:** ±3-5 points margin (response bias, sampling error, question interpretation)
- **Cost calculations:** ±20-30% margin (many assumptions in lost productivity estimates; hard costs more accurate ±10%)
- **Overall assessment:** Core metrics (turnover, counts) are highly accurate; perceptual data (reasons, satisfaction) have moderate error; cost estimates have highest uncertainty

**Impact of Errors:** How errors affect conclusions
- **Direction of bias:** Most errors likely make problem look less severe than reality (social desirability, non-response, cost conservatism) → **Our estimates are probably conservative lower bounds**
- **Statistical significance:** Sample sizes large enough (666 employees, 156 departures) that moderate error rates don't threaten significance of findings
- **Trend reliability:** Despite measurement error, consistent trends across 3 years and multiple sources increase confidence that patterns are real
- **Decision quality:** Error levels are acceptable for strategic decision-making; would need higher precision for individual employee decisions but adequate for program design

### Organizational Context Assessment

#### Data Collection Environment

**Organizational Culture Impact:**
- **Data Culture Assessment:** **MEDIUM** - Organization values data but not data-driven culture
  - **Data Quality Priority:** **MEDIUM** - HR processes include data validation but not obsessive about perfect data; "good enough" culture
  - **Evidence:** Quarterly data audits exist but not comprehensive; some known data issues tolerated ("that's close enough"); Excel over sophisticated analytics tools
  - **Transparency Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - HR relatively open about problems and data with leadership; turnover dashboards shared in exec meetings; some sensitivity about manager-specific data
  - **Accountability Systems:** **MEDIUM** - Some data accuracy accountability (Finance audits for payroll) but no consequences for poor data quality; HR generalists responsible for data entry but no performance metrics on accuracy

**Political Factors:**
- **Pressure to Show Improvement:** **MEDIUM** - Some implicit pressure but not overt
  - HR wants to demonstrate value → risk of emphasizing positive metrics while downplaying negative
  - No evidence of data manipulation but presentation may be selectively optimistic
  - This independent academic analysis less subject to political pressure than internal reporting

- **Blame Culture Impact:** **LOW-MEDIUM** - Some defensiveness but not severe
  - Managers may be defensive about their team's turnover being scrutinized
  - HR may be sensitive about "failing" to solve retention problem
  - No evidence this affects data honesty but may affect how findings are received/acted upon

- **Resource Competition:** **MEDIUM** - Departments compete for budget/headcount
  - Turnover problem could be used to justify more HR headcount/budget
  - HR has incentive to demonstrate problem is significant (supports resource requests)
  - Counterbalance: Finance has incentive to minimize cost estimates (budget constraints)
  - **Assessment:** Political factors exist but multiple stakeholders with different interests provide checks/balances

#### System Limitations

**Technology Constraints:** How IT systems limit data quality/availability
- **Workday:** Robust system but not perfectly configured for all analyses
  - Can't easily report manager-specific turnover (requires manual workaround)
  - Career pathing/development tracking is manual (no integrated tool)
  - Reporting requires IT support for complex queries (delays)
  - Historical data pre-2022 migration has quality issues

- **Exit Interview Database:** Basic system (not sophisticated)
  - No automated text analysis (manual thematic coding required)
  - No integration with Workday (manual cross-referencing)
  - Limited reporting capabilities (Excel exports for analysis)

- **Engagement Survey:** External vendor system (limited control)
  - Can't customize as much as would like (standard Qualtrics questions)
  - Annual frequency limitation (can't do continuous pulse easily)
  - Demographic filtering limited to protect anonymity (can't drill down to small groups)

**Process Constraints:** How business processes affect data collection
- **Exit Interview Process:** Informal, inconsistent timing
  - Conducted anytime between resignation notice and last day (2-week window)
  - No standardized duration (some interviews 20 minutes, others 60 minutes depending on employee talkativeness)
  - HR generalist workload affects thoroughness (busy periods = quicker interviews)

- **Performance Review Process:** Annual cycle limits data freshness
  - Ratings are 6-12 months old by time of analysis
  - Calibration process is helpful but takes manager time (some skip calibration meetings)
  - Rating inflation is cultural norm (hard to change)

- **Termination Processing:** Manual steps introduce errors
  - Manager initiates termination in system → HR reviews → Payroll processes
  - Multiple handoffs create opportunity for delays/errors
  - Effective date sometimes negotiated (last day vs. notice date) creating ambiguity

**Resource Constraints:** How limited resources affect data quality
- **HR Bandwidth:** Small team (8 HR generalists + 2 HRBPs) serving 1,492 employees = 1:166 ratio
  - Exit interviews compete with other priorities (recruiting, employee relations)
  - Data entry/quality is secondary to urgent employee issues
  - No dedicated data analyst (HR generalist does analysis on top of other duties)

- **IT Support:** Limited IT bandwidth for custom reporting
  - Standard reports available but custom analysis requires IT ticket (2-3 week turnaround)
  - No self-service analytics tools (dependent on IT for complex queries)
  - IT priorities are business-critical systems (HR reporting is lower priority)

- **Budget:** No budget for sophisticated analytics tools
  - Using Excel and basic Workday reporting (functional but not advanced)
  - Can't afford dedicated HR analytics software (Visier, OneModel)
  - Engagement survey is standard package (can't afford premium features)

### Quality Rating by Data Category

#### Performance Metrics (Turnover, Tenure, Costs)
- **Overall Quality Rating:** **HIGH** - Most reliable data category
- **Strengths:** 
  - Turnover rate is objective, system-captured, audited data (minimal subjectivity)
  - Large sample size (156 departures, 666 population) provides statistical power
  - Trend data over 3 years shows consistent patterns
  - Cross-system verification confirms accuracy
  - Industry benchmarks available for context
- **Limitations:**
  - Voluntary vs. involuntary coding has ~5% gray area
  - Cost calculations include estimates (lost productivity not directly measured)
  - Doesn't capture intent to leave (only backward-looking)
- **Decision Support Value:** **Very High** - These metrics clearly demonstrate problem magnitude and financial impact; confident using for executive business case and ROI projections

#### Exit Interview Data (Qualitative Reasons)
- **Overall Quality Rating:** **MEDIUM** - Valuable insights but significant biases
- **Strengths:**
  - Direct feedback from departing employees about why they left
  - Consistent themes over time (career development, manager quality)
  - Themes align with engagement survey data (triangulation)
  - Qualitative richness provides context beyond numbers
- **Limitations:**
  - 32% non-response creates survivorship bias
  - Social desirability bias softens criticism
  - Self-reported reasons may not reflect underlying causes
  - Interview quality varies by HR generalist thoroughness
- **Decision Support Value:** **High for directional insights, Medium for precise estimates** - Confident that career development and manager quality are real issues; less confident about exact percentages (73%, 61%) due to biases; useful for identifying solution focus areas but wouldn't rely solely on exit interview data for decision

#### Engagement Survey Data (Perceptions & Attitudes)
- **Overall Quality Rating:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Good for measuring sentiment, less reliable for predicting behavior
- **Strengths:**
  - Validated survey instrument with benchmarking database
  - Strong response rate (76%) reduces non-response bias
  - Anonymous format encourages honesty
  - Consistent measurement over 3 years enables trend analysis
  - Statistical significance testing confirms findings are not chance
- **Limitations:**
  - Measures perceptions, not objective reality
  - Annual frequency limits real-time tracking
  - Point-in-time snapshot may be affected by recent events
  - 24% non-response may include most disengaged employees
  - Correlation with turnover is not perfect (some low-engagement employees stay)
- **Decision Support Value:** **High for identifying focus areas, Medium for predicting outcomes** - Confident that career development and manager dimensions are problem areas for millennials/Gen Z; engagement scores successfully identified at-risk population (<60 score); useful for targeting interventions but wouldn't use scores alone to predict individual turnover

#### Financial Data (Budgets, Costs, Investments)
- **Overall Quality Rating:** **MEDIUM** - Directionally accurate but includes estimates
- **Strengths:**
  - Hard costs (recruiting spend, training costs) are actual financial data from systems
  - Budget allocations are documented and approved
  - Finance controls ensure accuracy of transaction data
  - Industry benchmarks available for validation (SHRM turnover cost estimates)
- **Limitations:**
  - Lost productivity costs are estimated using industry assumptions (not measured directly in our organization)
  - Knowledge loss costs are "soft" estimates (hard to quantify precisely)
  - ROI projections for solutions are theoretical (based on assumptions about effectiveness)
  - Opportunity costs are hypothetical (what could have been)
- **Decision Support Value:** **Medium-High for business case, Medium for precise budgeting** - Confident that turnover costs are in the $3-4M range (even if not exactly $3.94M); estimates are conservative so actual costs likely higher; adequate for making business case that problem is expensive and worth solving; less precise for exact ROI calculations but good enough for strategic decision

## Overall Organizational Evidence Assessment

### Strengths of Organizational Evidence

1. **Convergent Validity Across Multiple Sources:** Exit interviews, engagement surveys, turnover data, and historical reports all point to same root causes (career development, manager quality) → High confidence these are real issues, not measurement artifacts

2. **Large Sample Sizes Provide Statistical Power:** 666 millennial/Gen Z employees, 156 departures, 512 survey responses = sufficient numbers for reliable statistics and subgroup analysis

3. **Objective Turnover Data is High Quality:** HRIS-captured termination data is reliable, audited, system-verified; turnover rate calculations are trustworthy

4. **Clear Trends Over Time Strengthen Conclusions:** Consistent worsening over 3 years (2022→2024) reduces likelihood that findings are random fluctuation; trend acceleration is real signal

5. **External Benchmarking Provides Context:** Comparison to SHRM industry standards, Gallup research, Qualtrics norms helps separate organizational problems from universal issues; our 29% above-average turnover indicates organizational factors not just market

### Limitations of Organizational Evidence

1. **Exit Interview Non-Response Bias (32%):** Missing feedback from 1/3 of departures, likely including most negative experiences → Problem may be worse than data suggests

2. **Social Desirability Bias in Self-Reported Data:** Engagement surveys and exit interviews may understate dissatisfaction due to fear/politeness → Conservative estimates of problem severity

3. **Performance Rating Inflation Reduces Precision:** Subjective ratings with known inflation makes "high performer" identification imperfect; may overstate high-performer loss

4. **Lack of Predictive Leading Indicators:** Data is backward-looking (turnover already happened); don't have forward-looking metrics to identify at-risk employees before they decide to leave

5. **Limited Causal Evidence:** Can identify correlations (low engagement → turnover) but organizational data doesn't prove causation; can't definitively say "manager quality causes turnover" only that they're associated

### Confidence Level for Decision-Making

**Overall Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (7/10)**

**Justification:**
- **High confidence (9/10)** that millennial/Gen Z retention problem exists and is significant
  - Multiple independent data sources confirm problem
  - Magnitude is clear (23.4% turnover, $3.9M cost)
  - Trend is worsening, not improving
  - Problem is concentrated in this cohort (not organization-wide)

- **Medium-High confidence (7/10)** in root causes identified
  - Career development and manager quality emerge consistently across sources
  - Alignment between exit interview themes and engagement survey gaps
  - Matches external research (Gallup, Deloitte)
  - **But:** Self-reported data has biases; can't prove causation definitively; other unmeasured factors may contribute

- **Medium confidence (6/10)** in solution feasibility assessment
  - Budget availability is documented (high confidence in $420K allocation)
  - Leadership support is demonstrated but competing priorities may dilute focus
  - Change management track record is mixed (65% success rate)
  - **Uncertainty:** Will organization follow through this time given 2022 recommendations were not implemented?

- **Medium confidence (5/10)** in precise cost/ROI estimates
  - Hard costs are reliable; soft costs are estimated
  - Range is wide ($3.1M-$6.2M) indicating uncertainty
  - ROI projections depend on assumptions about solution effectiveness
  - **But:** Direction is clear even if precise numbers uncertain (problem is expensive)

**Adequate for Decision-Making:** YES - Despite limitations, evidence quality is sufficient to:
1. Make business case that problem requires investment (magnitude and cost data reliable)
2. Identify solution focus areas (career development, manager training) with confidence
3. Design targeted interventions (know which departments, which cohorts)
4. Set success metrics (baseline turnover, engagement scores established)
5. Allocate resources (budget availability confirmed)

**Would benefit from:** Longitudinal study to establish stronger causal evidence; external audit to validate data quality; predictive analytics to identify at-risk employees proactively

### Recommendations for Data Improvement

**Immediate Improvements (0-3 months):**
1. **Increase exit interview completion rate:** Incentivize participation (Amazon gift card), make interviews truly confidential (third-party administrator), keep interviews short (15 min)
2. **Add predictive leading indicator:** Implement quarterly pulse survey with "intent to stay" question to identify at-risk employees before they resign
3. **Improve manager-level reporting:** Work with IT to create manager turnover dashboard (anonymized if <5 employees) to enable targeted interventions

**Short-Term Improvements (3-6 months):**
4. **Conduct external data quality audit:** Engage third-party to validate HRIS data accuracy, exit interview coding reliability
5. **Implement stay interviews:** Supplement exit interviews with interviews of high performers who stay (understand retention factors, not just departure factors)
6. **Add career pathing tracking:** Enhance Workday to track career conversations, development plan progress (currently manual/untracked)

**Long-Term Improvements (6-12 months):**
7. **Invest in HR analytics capabilities:** Hire dedicated people analytics specialist or implement analytics software (Visier, OneModel) for sophisticated analysis
8. **Move to continuous feedback model:** Replace annual engagement survey with quarterly pulses for more real-time data
9. **Establish retention cohort study:** Track cohort of at-risk employees over time to validate predictive models and understand causal pathways

### Integration with Other Evidence Types

**Complementary Evidence Needs:**
- **Scientific evidence (peer-reviewed research):** Provides causal evidence that organizational data can't (e.g., Gallup's research proves manager quality causes engagement/retention using longitudinal designs) → Compensates for organizational data's correlational limitations
- **Practitioner evidence (case studies, implementations):** Shows what solutions actually work in practice → Compensates for organizational data's lack of implementation track record
- **Stakeholder evidence (employee/manager perspectives):** Provides context and buy-in for solutions → Compensates for organizational data's lack of qualitative depth and implementation feasibility insights

**Triangulation Opportunities:**
- **Exit interview themes ↔ Engagement survey dimensions:** Both show career development and manager quality as top issues → **Strong convergence increases confidence**
- **Turnover trend ↔ Engagement trend:** Both worsening over same time period → **Supports causal hypothesis that declining engagement leads to turnover**
- **Internal data ↔ External research:** Our findings (career development 73%, manager concerns 61%) match Gallup data (87% want development, manager 70% of variance) → **External validation of internal findings**
- **Organizational costs ↔ Industry benchmarks:** Our $25K per-departure cost aligns with SHRM estimates → **Validates cost methodology**
- **2022 predictions ↔ 2024 reality:** Report predicted 22-25% turnover; actual is 23.4% → **Historical predictive validity strengthens confidence in current analysis**

---
FINAL ASSESSMENT: Organizational evidence is solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making. Limitations exist (biases, gaps) but are well-understood and manageable. Convergence across multiple data sources strengthens conclusions beyond what any single source could provide. Evidence quality is sufficient to proceed with confidence to solution design and implementation.
