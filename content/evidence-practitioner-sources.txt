## SOURCE 1: GALLUP HR PRACTITIONERS - HBR

**Publication:** "What Millennials Want from a New Job" - Harvard Business Review (May 2016)
**Authors:** Brandon Rigoni, Ph.D. & Amy Adkins (Gallup Senior Consultants, 15+ years experience)

### KEY FINDING: Job-Hopping is Real
"21% of millennials say they've changed jobs within the past year, which is more than three times the number of non-millennials."

### PRACTITIONER INSIGHTS:

**1. Development Over Paychecks**
- Quote: "Millennials don't just work for a paycheck—they want a purpose. When opportunities to learn and grow are not readily available, they will look elsewhere."
- Tactic: Create visible career pathways within first 90 days
- Warning: Annual development conversations insufficient—needs ongoing dialogue

**2. Manager as Coach**
- Observation: "Millennials want their manager to be more of a coach than a boss"
- Implementation: Train managers in weekly check-ins focused on goals/development
- Result: Engaged managers → 2.5x higher millennial retention

**3. Ongoing Conversations Replace Annual Reviews**
- Recommendation: Replace annual reviews with:
  * Weekly 15-20 min check-ins
  * Monthly 30-60 min development talks
  * Quarterly goal-setting
- Impact: 59% higher engagement with ongoing conversations

**4. Strengths-Based Development**
- Principle: Focus on what people do best, not fixing weaknesses
- Method: Use strengths assessments + build roles around talents
- Stat: 69% more engaged when manager helps set priorities

### Challenges Acknowledged:
- Requires 20-40 hours manager training investment
- Older managers may resist coaching style
- Weekly conversations need calendar discipline
- May require reduced manager span of control

## SOURCE 2: HR EXECUTIVE MAGAZINE PRACTITIONERS (2024-2025)

### A. WORK FLEXIBILITY IMPLEMENTATION

**Practitioner Consensus:** Flexibility is baseline expectation; details matter

**Successful Models:**

1. **Hybrid Work** (Most Common)
   - Structure: 2-3 days office, 2-3 days remote
   - Critical Success Factor: Consistent team schedules
   - Timeline: 3-6 months to establish norms
   - Warning: "Don't mandate without training managers on hybrid leadership"

2. **Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE)**
   - Principle: Evaluated on output, not hours/location
   - Best For: Knowledge work with measurable deliverables
   - Challenge: Requires 6-12 month culture shift
   - Note: "Works best after establishing team foundations first"

3. **Flexible Hours**
   - Models: Core hours (10am-3pm) or compressed workweeks
   - Success Factor: Clear availability expectations + calendar transparency
   - Industries: Tech, professional services, creative

**Common Failures:**
- Flexibility announced without manager training → inconsistent application
- Not updating performance systems → managers measure hours as performance proxy
- Insufficient technology → frustration and lost productivity
- No intentional connection time → isolation

### B. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

**1. Individual Development Plans (IDPs)**
   - Structure: 6-12 month goals aligned with aspirations
   - Process: Co-created in first 30-90 days
   - Cadence: Monthly check-ins, quarterly updates
   - Training: Managers need 4-8 hours + coaching
   - Target: 70-80% employees with active IDP
   - Insight: "IDPs fail when treated as HR paperwork vs. living roadmap"

**2. Skills-Based Development**
   - Approach: Build portable skills (not just company-specific)
   - Methods:
     * Online platforms (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera)
     * Lunch-and-learns with internal experts
     * 90-day stretch assignments
     * External conferences ($500-2000/person/year)
   - Preference: Self-directed learning + mentorship > classroom
   - Note: "Younger employees want 'leveling' systems showing skill → career progression"

**3. Internal Mobility**
   - Best Practice: Explore roles after 18-24 months (no manager permission required)
   - Infrastructure: Internal job board + transparent process + manager training on "talent sharing"
   - Culture Shift: Managers rewarded for developing talent that moves internally
   - Result: 20-30% lower external turnover
   - Timeline: 12-18 months for cultural adoption

### C. MANAGER TRAINING & ENABLEMENT

**Consensus:** "Your retention problem is often a manager problem"

**Critical Training Areas:**

1. **Coaching Skills** (16-24 hours + ongoing practice)
   - Active listening and questioning
   - Goal-setting frameworks
   - Real-time feedback delivery
   - Development planning

2. **Career Conversations** (8 hours)
   - Discussing aspirations without false promises
   - Connecting work to long-term goals
   - Identifying development opportunities
   - Managing ambitious employees

3. **Managing Flexibility** (4-8 hours)
   - Setting hybrid/flexible norms
   - Measuring results not hours
   - Building connection in distributed teams
   - Addressing remote performance issues

**Implementation:**
- Phase 1: Train senior leaders first
- Phase 2: Mid-managers in cohorts
- Phase 3: Quarterly refreshers + coaching
- Budget: $1,000-3,000/manager

**Warning:** "Manager training without changing performance expectations won't stick. Must evaluate managers on retention and development, not just business results."

---

## PRACTITIONER CONCLUSION:

**Consistent Message Across All Sources:**

"Millennial/Gen Z retention requires systemic changes, not quick fixes. Core solution: invest in managers as coaches, create clear development pathways, offer work flexibility, and build purposeful culture. Implementation varies by industry and size, but fundamentals don't change."

"Organizations winning retention aren't necessarily paying most or offering flashiest perks. They're where managers are trained coaches, careers are visible and supported, work is flexible, recognition is continuous, and purpose is authentic. Takes 18-24 months to shift culture, but ROI on reduced turnover alone justifies investment."

"Start with manager capability—highest leverage point. Train managers to coach, not boss. Teach career conversations. Give tools for recognition and flexibility. Everything else builds from that foundation."

**Bottom Line from Practitioners:** Manager-centric, development-focused, flexibility-enabled approach proven across industries. Tactics work, but require sustained commitment, adequate investment, and cultural transformation—not just policy announcements.
