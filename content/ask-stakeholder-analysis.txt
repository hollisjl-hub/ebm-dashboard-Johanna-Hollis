# Stakeholder Analysis Framework

## Overview and Purpose

Our stakeholder analysis examines the complex network of parties affected by the
employee retention challenge and its proposed solutions. Using an influence/interest
matrix approach, we've identified key stakeholders and their relationships to the
problem, ensuring comprehensive understanding of motivations, potential conflicts,
and opportunities for alignment.

## Primary Stakeholders (High Influence, High Interest)

Senior management leads our primary stakeholder group, wielding significant influence
through control of budgets, policies, and strategic priorities. Their high interest
stems from both financial concerns ($4,129 average cost per turnover) and
strategic implications, including knowledge loss and efficiency reduction of
20-40% during transitions. The HR department shares this primary position, with
direct responsibility for program design and implementation, while facing increased
workload from continuous recruitment cycles.

Middle management occupies a crucial position with high influence as direct
implementers of retention strategies and primary sources of employee feedback.
Their interest is driven by practical challenges: constant retraining burdens
(1-2.5 months per new hire) and team performance instability. However, their
support may vary based on required changes to management approaches and additional
training needs.

## Secondary Stakeholders (Varying Influence/Interest)

Employees represent a complex stakeholder group with high interest but varying
influence. Their concerns center on career growth (49% would leave for better
development), work-life balance (73% of Gen Z priority), and engagement (only 31%
highly engaged). While they are the primary beneficiaries of improvements, their
influence manifests through collective actions and cultural impact.

External stakeholders include customers and industry partners, whose interest stems
from service consistency and relationship stability concerns, though their
influence is more limited. Regulatory bodies maintain moderate influence through
compliance requirements but show neutral interest unless specific workplace
standards are violated.

## Alignment Opportunities and Conflicts

Key alignment opportunities exist between senior management's cost-reduction goals
and employees' desires for better development and benefits. HR's program
objectives naturally align with both groups, creating a strong foundation for
change. However, potential conflicts arise from middle management's implementation
challenges and resistance to new approaches, requiring careful change management
and support systems.

Cross-stakeholder collaboration opportunities emerge around technology integration,
flexible work arrangements, and career development programs, where benefits can
cascade across multiple groups. Careful attention to these alignments while
proactively addressing conflicts will be crucial for successful implementation of
retention strategies.
