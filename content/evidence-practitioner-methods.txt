## Documentation Strategy

### Information Capture Process
1. **Initial reading** - Identified practitioner articles vs. pure academic research
2. **Detailed extraction** - Captured specific tactics, tools, and recommendations
3. **Implementation focus** - Documented HOW things were done, not just WHAT
4. **Challenge documentation** - Noted practitioner warnings and common pitfalls
5. **Results tracking** - Recorded quantified outcomes when provided
6. **Cross-validation** - Checked for consistency across multiple practitioners

### Analysis Approach
**Synthesis Method:**
- Grouped similar recommendations across different sources
- Distinguished between strategic principles and tactical implementations
- Identified implementation prerequisites and proper sequencing
- Noted variations by company size, industry, or workforce characteristics
- Tracked which recommendations had strongest cross-source support

**Evidence Quality Markers:**
✓ Practitioner has documented direct implementation experience
✓ Specific tactics described with operational details
✓ Results quantified (even if imperfectly)
✓ Challenges and limitations acknowledged honestly
✓ Recommendations grounded in specific organizational context
✓ Multiple practitioners independently recommend similar approaches

## Validation Approach

### Triangulation Strategy
Cross-referenced practitioner insights with:
1. **Multiple practitioner sources** - Looked for consistent recommendations across independent practitioners
2. **Scientific research validation** - Confirmed practitioner advice aligns with research findings from scientific evidence
3. **Reported outcomes** - Prioritized tactics with documented success metrics
4. **Industry recognition** - Considered companies recognized as "best places to work" for millennials/Gen Z

### Quality Filters Applied
**Included evidence when:**
- Practitioner has verifiable credentials and experience
- Specific implementation details provided (not just conceptual advice)
- Acknowledged both successes and challenges
- Results reported (quantified or qualitative)
- Multiple independent sources recommended similar approaches

**Excluded evidence when:**
- Purely theoretical or academic (not practitioner-based)
- Vague generalizations without operational details
- Unrealistic claims ("solved all problems overnight")
- No context about organization type, size, or industry
- Conflicts significantly with research-based evidence

## Expected Challenges & Mitigation

### Publication Bias
**Challenge:** Successful implementations more likely published than failures
**Mitigation:** 
- Sought sources that acknowledged implementation challenges
- Looked for practitioner candor about what didn't work
- Cross-validated claims against research findings
- Prioritized sources that discussed limitations

### Lack of Experimental Controls
**Challenge:** Can't isolate effects of specific tactics in real organizations
**Mitigation:**
- Looked for practitioners who implemented multiple tactics and noted relative impact
- Sought before/after data where available
- Compared experiences across similar organizations

### Self-Reported Results
**Challenge:** Practitioners may overstate success of their initiatives
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritized sources with specific quantified metrics
- Looked for third-party validation (awards, external recognition)
- Cross-validated results against industry benchmarks

### Limited Direct Access
**Challenge:** Relying on published accounts vs. primary interviews
**Mitigation:**
- Used multiple independent sources to validate recommendations
- Sought recent publications (2020-2025) for current relevance
- Prioritized detailed case studies over brief mentions

### Generalizability Questions
**Challenge:** What worked in one context may not transfer to all situations
**Mitigation:**
- Documented organizational context for each case (size, industry, demographics)
- Looked for successful implementations across diverse settings
- Noted practitioner caveats about situational factors

## Ethical Considerations

### Use of Published Information
- All sources are publicly published professional content
- Proper attribution maintained for all practitioner insights
- No confidential or proprietary information included
- Focus on generalizable lessons vs. organization-specific details

### Academic Integrity
- Clear distinction between practitioner evidence and scientific research
- Honest acknowledgment of evidence limitations
- No cherry-picking of only supporting evidence
- Balanced presentation of challenges alongside successes

⚠ **Self-reported data** - Practitioners may overstate success or downplay challenges
⚠ **No primary interviews** - Relying on published accounts, not direct practitioner access
⚠ **Generalizability uncertainty** - Context-specific successes may not universally transfer
