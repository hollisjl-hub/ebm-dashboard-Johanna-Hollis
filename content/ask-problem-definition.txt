# Problem Definition Framework

## Problem Focus and Statement (400 words)

Modern organizations face increasing difficulty retaining younger employees who view
frequent job changes as normal rather than risky. With average turnover rates of 18%
for Millennials and 20% for Gen Z employees, companies are experiencing significant
operational and financial impacts. Current data shows that 49% of employees would 
leave their current role for better development opportunities, while only 31% report
feeling highly engaged at work. This challenge is compounded by replacement costs 
ranging from 50% to 200% of annual salary per departure, averaging $4,129 per 
employee (SHRM, 2024).

The core issue extends beyond mere turnover numbers, as 65% of employees are actively
seeking new jobs due to lack of growth opportunities, and 73% of Gen Z workers
prioritize work-life balance over traditional benefits. This shift in workforce
values and expectations requires a fundamental reimagining of employee retention
strategies, as conventional loyalty incentives no longer effectively maintain
workforce stability and engagement.

## Clear Problem Statement
Modern organizations face increasing difficulty retaining younger employees who view
frequent job changes as normal rather than risky. Millennials and Gen Z prioritize
growth, flexibility, and work-life balance over long-term loyalty, leading to

to build employee commitment and satisfaction in a workforce where traditional 
loyalty incentives no longer work.
