# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering stakeholder perspectives and feedback

## Stakeholder Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Understand how different stakeholder groups experience the millennial/Gen Z retention crisis - specifically gathering insights on: (1) What factors employees prioritize when deciding to stay or leave (career growth vs. flexibility vs. work-life balance vs. compensation), (2) How managers perceive their capacity and capability to retain younger talent, (3) Whether leadership understands the severity and root causes of the problem, (4) How turnover impacts customers and external partners.

**Secondary Goal:** Gather stakeholder feedback on proposed retention solution components (flexible work arrangements, accelerated career development pathways, personalized learning platforms, mental health programs, modern benefits, regular feedback systems) to assess: (1) Feasibility and implementation barriers from manager/leadership perspective, (2) Appeal and credibility of solutions from employee perspective, (3) Resource commitment willingness from senior management, (4) Potential unintended consequences or conflicts between stakeholder interests.

### Focus Groups (if applicable)

#### Focus Group Design
- **Group Size:** 6-8 participants per group (optimal for discussion without being unwieldy)
- **Number of Groups:** 
  - 3 employee focus groups (by role type as noted above)
  - 1 SVP focus group (4 senior leaders)
  - 1 HR team focus group (10 HR professionals)
  - **Total: 5 focus groups**

- **Group Composition:** 
  - Employee groups: Homogeneous by function (technical, client-facing, support) to enable depth on role-specific challenges
  - Leadership group: Mixed functions (intentional cross-functional perspective)
  - HR group: All HR team members together (open dialogue about implementation)

- **Facilitation:** 
  - External facilitator for employee focus groups (encourage openness without HR presence creating social desirability bias)
  - HR Director facilitates leadership focus group (executive peer dynamics)
  - Project lead facilitates HR focus group (needs internal context)

## Sampling Strategy

### Stakeholder Identification

#### Stakeholder Mapping
**Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest):**
1. C-Suite (4): CEO, CFO, COO, CHRO - Final decision authority on resources and priorities
2. SVPs (8): All department heads - Implementation leaders and resource gatekeepers
3. HR Leadership (2): HR Director + Talent Management Lead - Solution designers
4. High-turnover Department Directors (6): Engineering, Sales, Operations leadership - Problem most acute

**Secondary Stakeholders (Power or Interest, but not both High):**
5. All Directors (42): Implementation layer, varying interest/impact
6. Middle Managers (132): Implementation executors, high interest in workability
7. Millenni/Gen Z Employees (666): Problem population, high interest but limited individual power
8. Customers (50 targeted): External impact, moderate interest/low power
9. Partners (8): Solution enablers, moderate interest/low power

**Target Engagement Priority:**
- Tier 1 (Must engage): C-suite, SVPs, HR leadership, high-turnover directors = 20 people
- Tier 2 (Should engage): Broader directors, representative managers, employee sample = ~150 people
- Tier 3 (Nice to engage): All managers, large employee sample, clients, partners = ~400 people

#### Sampling Approach
- **Total Target Sample:** 570 stakeholders across all methods
  - Leadership: 27 (census of C-suite/SVPs + director sample)
  - Managers: 102 (stratified sample representing high/low turnover teams, role types)
  - Employees: 340 (stratified by performance, potential, tenure, risk)
  - HR: 10 (census)
  - Clients: 25 (purposive sample of accounts experiencing turnover)
  - Partners: 8 (census of key vendors)

- **Sampling Method:**
  - **Census:** C-suite, SVPs, HR team, partners (small populations, need all voices)
  - **Stratified random:** Directors (stratified by turnover rate), Managers (stratified by team size and function)
  - **Purposive:** Employees (target specific risk categories), Clients (target those impacted by turnover)

- **Representation Goals:**
  - Gender diversity: Track to ensure 45-55% each (organization is 48% female)
  - Generational spread: Ensure both millennials (ages 29-43) and Gen Z (ages 22-28) represented
  - Department coverage: Minimum 15% of each major function
  - Tenure diversity: <1 year, 1-2 years, 2-5 years, 5+ years all represented
  - Performance levels: High/average/low performers included (avoid only high-performer bias)
