# Success Criteria Framework

## Primary Success Metrics (SMART)

Our retention strategy's success will be evaluated through three primary metrics,
each following SMART criteria. The main objective targets a reduction in employee
turnover from 30% to 24% within 12 months, representing a 20% improvement. This
goal is specific (focuses on retention rate), measurable (through HR analytics),
achievable (based on industry benchmarks), relevant (directly addresses the core
problem), and time-bound (12-month timeline).

Supporting this, we aim to increase the average employee engagement score from 65%
to 75% by year-end, measured through quarterly surveys. The third primary metric
focuses on cost efficiency, targeting a reduction in recruitment and training
costs from $5,000 to $4,000 per employee annually.

## Secondary Success Indicators

To provide a comprehensive view of progress, we'll track several secondary
indicators. Average employee tenure should increase from 2.5 to 3.0 years within
the 12-month period. Training efficiency will be measured by a 20% reduction in
onboarding hours per new hire. Additionally, qualitative improvements in exit
interview feedback and team morale assessments will validate our progress.

## Leading Indicators and Early Warning Signs

We've identified key leading indicators to provide early feedback on our
initiatives' effectiveness. These include:
- Program participation rates (target: >80% in first 3 months)
- Pulse survey response rates (minimum 70% participation)
- One-on-one meeting completion rates (target: >85% monthly)
- Internal referral rates (expected 25% increase by month 6)
- Voluntary training program enrollment (target: 60% in first quarter)

## Implementation Timeline and Milestones

The success criteria will be evaluated against a clear timeline:

Phase 1 (Months 1-3):
- Establish baseline measurements for all metrics
- Launch initial engagement programs
- Achieve 80% participation in new initiatives
- Complete first pulse survey cycle

Phase 2 (Months 4-6):
- Evaluate early turnover trends (expect 5-10% improvement)
- Review initial cost savings
- Assess engagement score improvements
- Adjust programs based on early feedback

Phase 3 (Months 7-12):
- Track progress toward 20% turnover reduction goal
- Measure full financial impact
- Evaluate engagement score improvements
- Document qualitative improvements
- Prepare comprehensive year-end assessment
