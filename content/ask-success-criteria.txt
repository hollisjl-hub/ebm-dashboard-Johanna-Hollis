# Success Criteria Framework

================================================================================
WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE: Triple-Metric Dashboard
================================================================================

Our retention strategy success will be measured through three interdependent 
metrics, each providing a different lens on organizational health. Together, they 
create a comprehensive view of whether our interventions are working.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY METRIC 1: Turnover Rate Reduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASELINE → TARGET → MEASUREMENT

Current State: 30% annual turnover (ages 25-40)
Target State:  24% annual turnover (ages 25-40)
Timeline:      12-month implementation period

CALCULATION PRECISION
• Relative Reduction: 6 percentage points (30% - 24% = 6)
• Percentage Improvement: 20% relative reduction (6 ÷ 30 = 0.20)
• Industry Context: Moving from 67% above benchmark (18%) to 33% above

Why This Target:
• Achievable Year 1 goal based on evidence-based intervention ROI
• Closes half the gap to industry benchmark (18% average)
• Represents saving ~30 departures (150 → 120 annually)
• Cost savings: $161,430 annually (30 × $5,381 per departure)
• Foundation for Year 2 goal of reaching 18% industry parity
• Pathway to 3-year aspiration of 85%+ retention (15% turnover)

Quarterly Tracking:
• Q1 (Months 1-3):  Baseline 30% → Monitor foundation phase
• Q2 (Months 4-6):  Target 28% → Early deployment impact (7% improvement)
• Q3 (Months 7-9):  Target 26% → Full rollout momentum (13% improvement)
• Q4 (Months 10-12): Target 24% → Sustained implementation (20% improvement)

Measurement Method:
• HR analytics system (Workday) monthly departure tracking
• Calculate rolling 3-month average for trend smoothing
• Segment by department, role type, tenure to identify variance
• Exit interview completion target: 85% to ensure data quality

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY METRIC 2: Employee Engagement Score
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASELINE → TARGET → MEASUREMENT

Current State: 64/100 engagement score (ages 25-40)
               71/100 organizational average (all ages)
Target State:  80/100 engagement score (ages 25-40)
Timeline:      12 months with quarterly pulse surveys

TOOL SPECIFICATION: Gallup Q12 Engagement Survey
• 12 validated questions measuring workplace engagement
• Scored 1-5 scale, converted to 0-100 percentage
• Addresses manager quality, development, purpose, recognition
• Industry-standard tool enabling external benchmarking

Why Gallup Q12:
• Directly aligns with our intervention components (development, feedback, purpose)
• Proven correlation with turnover, productivity, and profitability
• Allows comparison to Gallup's database of 30M+ respondents
• Quarterly tracking capability with short format (12 questions)

Engagement vs. Satisfaction Distinction:
• Satisfaction = contentment with current state ("I'm happy here")
• Engagement = commitment and discretionary effort ("I'm invested in success")
• Engagement predicts retention 3x better than satisfaction alone
• Gallup Q12 measures engagement specifically (e.g., "I know what's expected," 
  "My opinions count," "Someone encourages my development")

Quarterly Tracking:
• Q1 (Months 1-3):  Baseline 64 → Monitor during foundation
• Q2 (Months 4-6):  Target 70 → Manager training + feedback systems impact
• Q3 (Months 7-9):  Target 75 → Development pathways + purpose initiatives
• Q4 (Months 10-12): Target 80 → Full integration of all components

Measurement Method:
• Quarterly Gallup Q12 survey to all ages 25-40 employees (~500 people)
• Response rate target: 70% minimum for statistical validity
• Anonymous responses to encourage candor
• Segment by department, manager, role type for targeted interventions
• Track "actively engaged" (top 2 responses) vs. "actively disengaged" separately

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY METRIC 3: Replacement Cost Efficiency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASELINE → TARGET → MEASUREMENT

Current State: $5,381 per replacement (ages 25-40)
               • $4,129 direct replacement costs (SHRM)
               • $1,252 lost training investment
Target State:  $4,300 per replacement
Timeline:      Measured at 12-month mark

Cost Reduction Through Retention:
• Fewer replacements = primary savings (150 → 120 = 30 fewer departures)
• Annual savings: $161,430 (30 × $5,381)
• Additional efficiency gains from faster onboarding of remaining hires

Per-Replacement Efficiency Improvements:
• Reduced recruiting costs: Better employer brand → more referrals
• Faster time-to-productivity: Improved onboarding with mentorship
• Lower training costs: More effective development planning reduces redundancy
• Knowledge retention: Less institutional knowledge loss per remaining hire

Why This Metric Matters:
• Translates retention into language senior leadership prioritizes (financial ROI)
• Demonstrates program value even if turnover reduction falls short of 24% goal
• Creates business case for continued investment in Years 2-3
• Links to broader organizational efficiency and productivity goals

Measurement Method:
• Finance partnership to track recruiting, onboarding, training costs per hire
• HR analytics for time-to-productivity (manager assessments at 30/60/90 days)
• Exit interview data on knowledge loss impact (qualitative)
• Quarterly reporting with Year-over-Year comparison

================================================================================
SECONDARY SUCCESS INDICATORS: Early Warning & Validation
================================================================================

These metrics provide leading indicators of whether primary metrics will achieve 
targets, plus qualitative validation that improvements are authentic vs. superficial.

LEADING INDICATORS (Predict Future Turnover)

1. Average Employee Tenure at Departure
   Baseline: 18.3 months median
   Target:   24+ months median by Month 12
   Why: Longer tenure before departure indicates interventions extending retention

2. High-Performer Retention Rate
   Baseline: 29.5% of departures were top-rated talent
   Target:   <20% of departures are top-rated
   Why: Retaining best performers disproportionately important for succession

3. Internal Mobility Rate
   Baseline: <10% of ages 25-40 move to new internal roles annually
   Target:   25% experience internal move or promotion within 12 months
   Why: Internal career progression drives tenure extension (LinkedIn: +3.5 years)

4. Manager Effectiveness Score (360 Reviews)
   Baseline: 62/100 average manager rating by direct reports
   Target:   75/100 average by Month 12
   Why: Manager quality accounts for 70% of engagement variance

5. Development Plan Completion Rate
   Baseline: <30% have documented development plans
   Target:   90% have plans by Month 3, 80% complete quarterly milestones
   Why: Development drives retention (49% would leave for growth opportunities)


PROGRAM PARTICIPATION INDICATORS (Implementation Quality)

• Flexible work adoption: 80% eligible employees using hybrid/remote by Month 6
• One-on-one completion: 85% managers conduct bi-weekly meetings by Month 6
• Learning platform usage: 70% complete at least one course/quarter by Month 9
• Pulse survey response: 70% participation each quarter (validates engagement data)
• Internal referrals: 25% increase by Month 9 (employer brand improvement)


QUALITATIVE VALIDATION INDICATORS

Exit Interview Themes:
• Baseline: 73% cite limited career advancement, 61% cite manager concerns
• Target: <50% cite advancement, <40% cite manager by Month 12
• Method: Thematic coding of open-ended responses

Stay Interview Insights:
• New metric: Implement stay interviews with high-performers quarterly
• Track reasons for staying vs. considering leaving
• Identify early intervention opportunities before disengagement escalates

Team Morale Assessments:
• Manager check-ins on team stability and collaboration quality
• Qualitative feedback on whether turnover reduction improves team dynamics
• Cross-functional partner feedback on project continuity

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE: Measurement Points
================================================================================

The timeline clarifies WHEN we measure each metric relative to the three-phase 
implementation. This addresses whether we're tracking DURING or AFTER intervention 
deployment.

• Month 12: Comprehensive evaluation of all secondary indicators
• Month 12: Stay interview summary + exit interview thematic analysis

What We're Tracking: Full program outcomes + sustainability indicators


POST-IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING (Months 13-24)
• Quarterly Gallup Q12 surveys continue to track engagement sustainability
• Monthly turnover monitoring to ensure 24% maintained (or improved to 18%)
• Annual 360-degree manager effectiveness reviews
• Year 2 target: Maintain 24% or improve toward 18% industry benchmark
• Year 3 aspiration: Reach 85%+ retention (15% turnover) aligning with best practice

================================================================================
SUCCESS THRESHOLDS & RISK MITIGATION
================================================================================

DEFINING SUCCESS LEVELS

Full Success (All targets met):
• 30% → 24% turnover achieved (20% relative reduction)
• 64 → 80 engagement score achieved (25% improvement)
• $5,381 → $4,300 cost efficiency achieved
• All secondary indicators show positive trends
→ Continue current strategy, plan Year 2 stretch goals toward 18% turnover

Partial Success (2 of 3 primary metrics):
• Example: Turnover improves to 26% (13%), engagement hits 80, costs at $4,500
→ Analyze which intervention components drove success, double-down on those
→ Investigate barriers to full turnover target achievement
→ Extend timeline or adjust approach for underperforming areas

Minimal Success (1 of 3 primary metrics):
• Example: Engagement improves but turnover stays at 29%, costs unchanged
→ Deep-dive analysis: Are interventions insufficient or implementation flawed?
→ Stakeholder interviews to understand disconnects
→ Consider whether 12-month timeline too ambitious, extend to 18 months

Insufficient Success (0 of 3 primary metrics):
• Turnover unchanged or worsened, engagement flat or declining, costs rising
→ Fundamental reassessment required: Wrong problem diagnosis? Wrong solutions?
→ External expertise engagement (retention consultants, I-O psychologists)
→ Stakeholder trust repair through transparent acknowledgment and course correction


RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

Risk: Manager resistance or insufficient capacity
Mitigation: 
• Months 1-3 intensive training with ongoing monthly community of practice
• Reduce manager workload in other areas (recruiting burden decreases with retention)
• Recognize retention in performance evaluations and compensation
• Early wins celebrated to build momentum

Risk: Budget constraints limit full intervention deployment
Mitigation:
• Phase implementation to spread costs over 12 months
• Demonstrate early ROI (reduced recruiting costs in Q2) to justify continued investment
• Prioritize highest-impact components if budget cuts required (development, manager training)
• Secure executive sponsorship upfront with contingency planning

Risk: Employee skepticism from previous initiative failures
Mitigation:
• Transparent communication on timeline, milestones, and progress
• Co-design opportunities through focus groups and pulse survey feedback
• Celebrate quick wins visibly (Month 3: development plans complete, Month 6: flexible work adopted)
• Leadership visible commitment through modeling and regular updates

Risk: External factors (recession, industry disruption) affect retention
Mitigation:
• Track external benchmark changes to separate program impact from market trends
• Scenario planning for economic downturn impact on retention strategies
• Focus on controllable factors (manager quality, development, culture) vs. compensation competition
• Maintain measurement rigor to demonstrate program value even if absolute targets missed
