EVIDENCE SUMMARY BY TYPE
================================================================================

## SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### Key Finding 1: Manager Quality Drives 70% of Engagement Variance
**Finding:** Manager capability is the single strongest predictor of employee engagement and retention. Gallup research demonstrates managers account for 70% of variance in team engagement, with millennials/Gen Z especially sensitive to manager quality. Only 29% of millennials report being engaged at work, primarily due to inadequate management practices.

- **Source Quality:** HIGH
  - Gallup study: 195,600 U.S. employees (CAT assessment: A/Excellent)
  - Deloitte global survey: 22,841 respondents across 44 countries
  - Multiple independent studies converge on manager impact
  
- **Relevance to Context:** VERY HIGH
  - Our organizational data shows 61% of exit interviews cite manager concerns
  - Our manager effectiveness scores average 62/100 (below threshold)
  - Direct alignment with our identified problem drivers
  
- **Certainty Level:** VERY HIGH
  - Consistent findings across 6 independent studies
  - Large samples (57,000+ total respondents)
  - Longitudinal validation over 14 years (Deloitte tracking)

### Key Finding 2: Career Development is #1 Retention Driver for Ages 25-40
**Finding:** 49% of employees would leave for better development opportunities, and 87% of millennials rate development as critical to job satisfaction. Organizations with strong development cultures show 15% lower turnover.

- **Source Quality:** HIGH
  - Converging evidence from Gallup, Deloitte, Randstad, LinkedIn
  - LinkedIn data: 830M member behaviors showing internal mobility extends tenure by 3.5 years
  - SHRM validation with practitioner case studies
  
- **Relevance to Context:** VERY HIGH
  - Our exit interviews: 73% cite limited career advancement as primary factor
  - Our engagement survey: only 52% satisfied with growth opportunities
  - Median tenure of 18.3 months suggests inadequate early-career development
  
- **Certainty Level:** VERY HIGH
  - Universal agreement across all 6 scientific studies
  - Validated by practitioner implementations (HubSpot 34% reduction, Nationwide 26% reduction)
  - Strongest convergence across all evidence types

### Key Finding 3: Work-Life Integration is Baseline Expectation, Not Perk
**Finding:** 73% of Gen Z prioritize work-life balance over traditional benefits, and 75% require flexible work arrangements as baseline. Organizations offering 2-3 days hybrid show 23% lower turnover.

- **Source Quality:** HIGH
  - Deloitte global data: 44 countries, consistent findings
  - Randstad workmonitor: 11,250 respondents, 34 countries
  - Post-pandemic longitudinal data showing permanent expectation shift
  
- **Relevance to Context:** HIGH
  - Our stakeholder evidence: 84% view flexible work as feasible
  - Current rigid policies may drive preventable departures
  - Competitive disadvantage if peers offer flexibility we don't
  
- **Certainty Level:** HIGH
  - Consistent across generations (not just Gen Z preference)
  - Validated across geographic regions globally
  - Practitioner evidence confirms implementation feasibility

**Overall Scientific Evidence Strength:** HIGH

Strong convergence across 6 independent studies with large samples (57,000+ respondents). Evidence is recent (2022-2025), methodologically rigorous, and directly applicable to our context. CAT assessments rate top studies as A/Excellent quality.
