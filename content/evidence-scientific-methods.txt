## Research Question
How do younger generations (Millennials and Gen Z) differ from previous generations in their workplace expectations, retention patterns, and drivers of employee engagement?

**Primary Research Question:** What does research tell us about millennial and Gen Z turnover rates, job tenure patterns, and the factors driving their workplace decisions?
**Secondary Research Question:** What does research tell us about effective retention strategies, workplace policies, and organizational practices that improve engagement and reduce turnover among younger employees?

## Quality Assessment Approach
[How will you evaluate study quality?]

### Research Design Hierarchy
1. **Large-Scale National/Global Surveys** [Highest quality for workforce trends - large n, representative samples]
2. **Longitudinal Studies** [High quality - tracks changes over time]
3. **Cross-sectional Surveys with Controls** [Medium-high quality - snapshot comparisons]
4. **BLS/Government Data Analysis** [High quality - objective employment records]
5. **Industry Reports with Primary Data** [Medium quality - valuable but potential bias]
6. **Qualitative Studies/Expert Interviews** [Lower statistical power but valuable for context]

### Quality Criteria Checklist
- [X] Clear research question
- [X] Appropriate methodology (surveys, government data analysis)
- [X] Adequate sample size (studies range from 11,250 to 23,000+ respondents)
- [X] Valid measurement tools (standardized survey instruments, BLS data)
- [X] Appropriate statistical analysis (descriptive and comparative statistics)
- [X] Clear reporting of results (percentages, medians, cross-generational comparisons)
- [X] Discussion of limitations (where applicable)
- [X] Credible sources (established research organizations, government data)

## Documentation Process
[How you'll organize and track your findings]

### Reference Management
Using standard APA citation format. Maintaining source URLs and access dates for all web-based research sources. Organizing studies by primary theme (turnover/tenure, workplace expectations, retention strategies).

### Evidence Extraction Form
For each study, documenting:
- Full citation with author/organization, date, title, and URL
- Study design and methodology (survey size, data collection period, geographic scope)
- Sample characteristics (total n, age breakdown, industry representation)
- Key findings (percentages, medians, statistical comparisons)
- Relevance to problem (how findings relate to millennial/Gen Z retention challenges)
- Relevance to solution (implications for retention strategies and workplace policies)
- Quality assessment (sample size adequacy, methodology rigor, generalizability)

## Challenges and Limitations
[Document any issues with your search process]

### Search Limitations
Limited access to paywalled academic journals and proprietary research databases. Relied primarily on publicly accessible research reports, government data analyses, and established research organization publications. Some potential academic studies behind institutional paywalls could not be accessed.

### Resource Constraints
Time constraints limited comprehensive systematic review. Focused on highest-quality, most recent studies from credible sources rather than exhaustive literature review. Academic database subscriptions not available, so prioritized open-access and publicly available research.

### Topic-Specific Challenges
Rapidly evolving workforce landscape means findings may have short shelf life. Post-pandemic workplace dynamics are still stabilizing. Generational labels (Millennial, Gen Z) are imperfect categories with significant within-group variation. Some studies mix generational effects with life-stage effects, making causal attribution challenging.
